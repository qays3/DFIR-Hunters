An administrator cloned what appeared to be a legitimate Linux system administration toolkit, unknowingly deploying a sophisticated backdoor. The attacker established persistence, exfiltrated sensitive data, installed reconnaissance tools, and attempted to cover their tracks. Your mission: analyze the ELK stack logs to uncover the complete attack chain and answer all questions.
