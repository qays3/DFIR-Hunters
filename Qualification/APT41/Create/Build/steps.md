System Compromise - APT establishes foothold
Discovery & Escalation - Credential harvesting, lateral movement
Breach Detection - Company realizes they're compromised (5 minutes after attack)
Incident Response - Company urgently hires freelancer expert
Continued Attack - APT persists while incident response begins
